## Project 1 — YieldStar Log Quality-Assurance Automated Pipeline

**Problem.** Engineers manually parsed logs from multiple sources, delaying defect discovery.  
**Solution.** A validator packaged as a one-click tool that normalizes records, enforces schemas, flags anomalies, and caches results.

**Highlights**
- Validation & normalization: Utilize schema and regex checks, and normalize timestamps and fields.
- Resilience: Caching and idempotent retries for unstable inputs.
- Tooling & tests: Command-line tool (CLI) and synthetic fixtures for unit tests.

**Impact**
- Processing time **reduced ~90%**
- Packaged as a one-click CLI and adopted by the Software Testing team, now used daily in log triage

## P2 — Robot Framework API Test Suites & CI Quality Gates

**Problem.** Yieldstar Machine Log's post-merge defects surfaced late and occasionally reached `main`.

**Solution.** Robot Framework API test suites run in GitHub Actions; failing checks **block PR merges**. Test outputs are surfaced as **JUnit XML** in the PR UI, with coverage reported.

**Highlights**
- API checks: Ensure endpoints return correct status codes (e.g., 200/400), JSON matches the expected schema, and bad inputs produce clear errors.
- Consistent CI: Run automatic `pre-commit` checks and execute CI inside Docker so tests behave the same on every machine.
- Coverage: Use `pytest --cov` to report how much of the code is exercised by tests.

**Impact**
- **Post-merge defects ↓ ~80%**

**Pipeline (simplified)**

## P3 — React Log Viewer with Anomaly Flags

**Problem.** Ops needed faster triage and clearer signals to move from logs to investigation state.

**Solution.** A React web app that highlights anomalies via threshold and timestamp checks, supports filters and search, and links directly to the source record for follow-up.

**Highlights**
- See issues at a glance: Show row-level **anomaly badges** and time markers.
- Work faster: **Filter** by module, severity, and time window and **instant search**.
- One click to investigate: Build **deep links** to the exact record.
- Smooth data loading: **React Query** handles fetch,caching, and retries; **TypeScript** for safer user interface code.

**Impact**
- **Handoff-to-investigation time ↓ ~60%**

**UI Flow (simplified)**

## P4 — Power BI Ops Dashboards

**Problem.** Daily job health and anomaly trends were scattered across tools, making status reviews slow and inconsistent.

**Solution.** A set of Power BI dashboards with daily refresh, health checks, and runbooks so ops can review status in minutes and know exactly what to do next.

**Highlights**
- **Pipeline health:** Show success rate, latency, retry counts, recent failures, and so on.
- **Anomaly overview:** Flagged records by type, time, and module with drill-through and filters.
- **Runbooks:** Links to step-by-step fixes, owners, and escalation paths.
- **Reliable data flow:** Build Power Query (M) for shaping, scheduled refresh, and REST/CSV connectors bring in the sources.

**Impact**
- Faster daily reviews and clearer ownership and escalation during incidents
- Used across **domestic and international** teams for daily status reviews and incident follow-ups
